# my-java-tictactoe

I will try turning a simple Tic Tac Toe game to a more complex one using up-to-date technologies, most of them java-related. 
Let's see where I can get this game.

Done so far
1- Created a basic console-based Tic-tac-toe game
2- Added functionality to interupt a game and resume it later
3- Created a basic GUI using Swing
4- Use the JPA to save and load the game
5- (TODO) Make it so that 2 people can play over the internet
6- Create a new GUI using JavaFX
7- Switch to another, more challenging, version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
